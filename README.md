# 01-C-Microproject

In this project , we will write a small C program which reads a file, line by line, into an array and allows the user to retrieve the elements by index. 

Tasks:


`message.txt` is the input file. It contains, on the first line, an integer number of lines to read after that first line. Each line after that will contain some character string. 

When loaded, your program will make an array of length 3, and populate the cells with the lines of the program. After loading the file, your program should enter a command loop where the user can enter an index number and the program should output the corresponding string.
